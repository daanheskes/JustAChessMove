# Just A Chess Move

A Chess learning tool where you have to find a top-5 move in a random position.
There aren't necessarily any tactics, you have to just simply play a (good) move in the position.

## No engine implemented yet

The evaluations are hard-coded. There is no Chess engine like Stockfish implemented (yet).

## Try it out!
